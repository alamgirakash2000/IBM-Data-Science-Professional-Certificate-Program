<h1 align="center">IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</h1>

This is an online certification program offered by **IBM** on the platform
**[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**. This program is total 40 weeks long.
This is a combination of total **10** individual courses. One have to pass all
of those 10 courses in order the get this certificate. This is the
**[Link](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)**
of the program. The name of the courses are listed below:

<ol>
    <li>What is Data Science? - 3 weeks </li>
    <li>Tools for Data Science - 4 weeks </li>
    <li>Data Science Methodology - 3 weeks </li>
    <li>Python for Data Science, AI and Development -5 weeks </li>
    <li>Python Project for Data Science -1 week + 1 project </li>
    <li>Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python - 6 weeks </li>
    <li>Data Analysis with Python - 6 weeks </li>
    <li>Data Visualization with Python - 5 weeks </li>
    <li>Machine Learning with Python - 6 weeks </li>
    <li>Applied Data Science Capstone - Final Capstone projects </li>
 </ol>

This repository is to track my progress of this program and also store all the
projects that I have done while doing these courses.

## Project - 02: The Best Classifier

**[Notebook Link]()** This notebook is created for the final assignment of the
course named
**[Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python)**
on **Coursera**. In this assignment, I have implemented all the four type of
classification algorithm on a signle train and test dataset to figure out the
classifier for this dataset. The implemented classification algorithms are -

- k-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

We have also calculated different scores for all the classification algorithms
to figure out the best classifier. Like -

- Accuracy score
- Confussion Matrix
- Jaccard index
- F1-score
- LogLoass

## Project - 01: Data analysis of IPL matches

**[Link of the Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alamgirakash2000/data-analysis-with-python-ZeroToPandas/blob/main/data-analysis-of-ipl-matches.ipynb)**

This is a complete analysis of various things about the ipl matches. The dataset
has taken from Kaggle. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20
cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by
eight teams representing eight different cities in India. In this projects I
have use the popular Data analysis libraries like -
`NumPy`,`Pandas`,`Matplotlib`,`Seaborn` to visualize the dataset. Some advanced
visualization techniques have been used in this projects.
